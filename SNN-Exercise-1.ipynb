    "Neurons communicate via action potentials that propagate along axons (nerves) to synapses on the dendrites of the target/receiving neurons. The most important feature of an action potential is the **time** when it occurs, while their amplitudes and shapes are similar. In spiking neuron models, action potentials are represented by discrete events called **spikes** that are defined by the time of occurrence and some kind of identifier of the source neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spiking neuron models mimic natural neurons more closely than the activation-function based *units* of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which operate with *amplitudes* that qualitatively correspond to average spike frequencies. Spiking neurons have time-dependent states and can for example respond differently to two inputs with identical amplitudes but different temporal structure. Spiking neuron models are central in neuroscience and [neuromorphic engineering](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/sections/neuromorphic-engineering).\n",

    "In this exercise you will investigate and perform numerical experiments with the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model of neurons, see [Figure 1.6A](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html) in the book and the lectures for further information.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the LIF model we consider the cell membrane (big circle) of the neuron as a capacitor, $C$, that integrates an input current, $I(t)$, of ions from synapses. In addition, there is a parallel branch with a voltage source, $u_{rest}$, and a resistor, $R$, which corresponds to ion pumps and leakage of the cell membrane, respectively. When the membrane voltage, $u(t)$, reaches a threshold voltage, $u_{th}$, a spike is generated and $u(t)$ is reset. See the book for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulators like [Brian2](https://brian2.readthedocs.io) and [Neuronify](https://ovilab.net/neuronify/) can be used to quickly configure and simulate spiking neural networks (SNNs) of LIF neurons. However, in order to develop an understanding of spiking neurons and neural networks you will solve the corresponding differential equations numerically in this exercise. Some sample code is included below to get you started, and the resulting code will be reused in a subsequent SNN exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also investigate the delta modulator receptor neuron model introduced in the lectures, which introduces a central concept used in neuromorphic sensor systems like [dynamic vision sensors](https://inivation.com/dvp/). The receptor neuron model can be used to convert input signals to spikes that can be further processed with an SNN.\n",

The difference in concentration generates an equilibrium electrical potential called the *Nernst potential* which plays an important role in neuronal dynamics, see [Section 2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S1.html).\n",
